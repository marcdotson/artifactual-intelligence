# Annotated Bibliography

**[@Buchanan1979]**: Buchanan's very important book on methodology. 

- Chapter 5 titled *Natural and Artifactual Man* is im large measure the inspiration for out title of
  *Artifactual Intelligence*.
- The last chapter titled *Retrospect and Prospect* has some wonderful nuggets of pure wisdom. 

**[@HarperJIE2010]**: Examines numbers as technological objects constituted by both form 
and function, analyzing their role in economic systems. Argues that number sequences 
require both proper internal structure and external social network adoption to 
function effectively.

- Numerical toolkits are economic capital/economic institutions.
- It's not difficult to imagine how to extend this to computing machines. 
- Cites as epigraph the wonderful Mises quote on *economic calculation* as foundational. It is tantalizing
  to consider this quotation in our modern age of Big Data and AI/ML!

**[@HarperJBioEcn2008]**: Studies the biological and economic factors in the development 
of numerical cognition and calculation. Emphasizes how scarcity and economic needs drove 
the development of numerical tools and quantification abilities. The paper bridges 
evolutionary biology and institutional economics to explain the co-evolution of human 
numerical abilities and economic systems.

**[@HayekEconomica1937]**: A foundational paper examining the relationship between subjective 
knowledge and economic coordination. Hayek argues that the key economic problem facing 
society is how dispersed knowledge gets used in decentralized decision-making. This work 
laid the groundwork for later developments in Austrian economics regarding knowledge 
and social coordination.

**[@HayekAER1945]**: This seminal work explores how the price system enables the use 
of dispersed knowledge in society. Hayek emphasizes prices' role in communicating 
information and coordinating decentralized decision-making. The paper demonstrates 
why central planning faces insurmountable knowledge problems that markets can solve 
through the price mechanism.

**[@HighQJAE2009]**: Extends Menger's theory of institutional emergence to 
explain how social institutions like division of labor, monetary calculation, and 
property rights emerge through entrepreneurial processes rather than central planning. 
High shows how these institutions arise from individual entrepreneurial actions while 
producing unintended social benefits.

- Combined with @HarperJIE2010, this paper provides the framework for the institutional development
  of *human augmentative* and *intelligent infrastructure* systems (following Jordan) that we are
  arguing make up *artifactual intelligence*.

**[@HorwitzRSE1992]**: Analyzes money as a communication medium analogous to but 
distinct from language. Horwitz demonstrates how monetary exchange enables social 
coordination beyond linguistic limits by communicating economic knowledge through 
prices. The paper connects Austrian economics with social theory to explain money's 
role in complex economies.

**[@HorwitzHOPE1998]**: Traces the roots of Mises's economic calculation argument 
to his 1912 monetary theory. The paper demonstrates the centrality of monetary 
calculation to market coordination and critique of central planning. Horwitz shows 
the deep connection between Mises's monetary theory and his later critique of 
socialist planning.

**[@JordanHDSR2019]**: Argues that much of what is labeled as "artificial intelligence" today is actually machine learning operating within specific domains, and that the revolution in human-imitative AI has not yet occurred. Proposes reframing technological development around "Intelligence Infrastructure" (II) - systems that make human environments more supportive and safe while handling uncertainty and distributed decision-making. Emphasizes the need for a new engineering discipline focused on building reliable intelligent systems, drawing parallels to how fields like civil and chemical engineering emerged. Contends that this engineering approach must integrate economic thinking about markets and incentives while focusing on enhancing rather than replacing human capabilities.


**[@LachmannJEL1976]**: Traces the intellectual links between Ludwig von Mises's theory of monetary calculation and G.L.S. Shackle's view of the economy as a kaleidic society characterized by perpetual change and uncertainty. Shows how both theorists emphasized the role of economic calculation in helping actors navigate an uncertain future, while recognizing that such calculation can never achieve perfect coordination due to continuous change in knowledge and expectations. Advances Austrian business cycle theory by arguing that asset markets in particular exhibit inherent volatility that prevents the economic system from reaching long-run equilibrium. Shows how Austrian economics provides tools for understanding a world of permanent knowledge problems and divergent expectations.
