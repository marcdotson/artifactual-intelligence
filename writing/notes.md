# Notes


We’re constructing a critique of both frequentist statistics and
neoclassical economics. The availability of computation allows for
simulation and a “restoration” of both Bayesian statistics and Austrian
economics.

- What is the relationship between constructivism and the artifactual
  argument?
- What is the relationship with institutional economics?

Artifactual Intelligence: The Revolution in Probabilistic Machine
Learning and Decision Theory

Artificial intelligence has seen a substantial increase in attention.
However, the advances in and implications of artificial intelligence,
broadly defined, are generally not well understood by its practitioners
or the public. In this talk we provide a unifying perspective on
artificial intelligence rooted in the history of epistemology. This
perspective allows us to see AI for what it is – not artificial, but
*artifactual* – and how it sets the stage for a revolution in
probabilistic machine learning and decision theory.

## Outline

- Mises provides a (narrative) foundation for “economic calculation”
  with valuation and appraisement
- Hayek adds to this by arguing for a bottom-up consideration of
  equilibrium with the knowledge and coordination problem
- de Finneti provides a foundation for subjective probability and an
  anlytical form of Mises and Hayek’s ideas
- Combining Mises and Hayek with de Finneti gets us a fully subjective
  form of Austrian economic calculation
